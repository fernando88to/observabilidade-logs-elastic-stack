    ### Multiline options

    # Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
    # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

    # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
    #multiline.pattern: ^\[

    # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
    #multiline.negate: false

    # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
    # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
    # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
    #multiline.match: after

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here or by using the `setup` command.
#setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
setup.kibana:
  host: "kibana:5601"

# Kibana Host
# Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
# In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
# IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:5601

#============================= Elastic Cloud ==================================

# These settings simplify using Filebeat with the Elastic Cloud (https://cloud.elastic.co/).

# The cloud.id setting overwrites the `output.elasticsearch.hosts` and

# You can find the `cloud.id` in the Elastic Cloud web UI.

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  hosts: ["es01:9200"]

  # Protocol - either `http` (default) or `https`.
  #protocol: "https"

  # Authentication credentials - either API key or username/password.
